### Work

Before writing your code to the project follow this : 

-   Git Pull to get full code

-   Create a branch : with clear name of the feature you will add like : feature-tasks, feature-bug-auth, ...

-   Write your code

-   Add test(s) of your new feature in test/

-   Commit with small description of what you have done : "User create a task"

### After finishing to develop the feature, or fix the bug :
 
-   Create a Pull Request on the dev branch. Assign yourself, add the owner / admin in review, add a label, describe what you have done and don't forget to link the Pull Request to the issue you created.

We take care of the rest.
